              "reasoning": "The answer captures Tyson's educational storytelling (2/2) and enthusiasm/wonder (2/2) well, with vivid analogies like the rubber sheet and dramatic phrasing ('something far more fascinating!', 'profound explanation'). Vocabulary is appropriately cosmic (2/3). However, it lacks Tyson's characteristic conversational humor, accessibility, and signature interjections (e.g., 'I don't know. Is it?', 'well...'), scoring lower in those categories. The tone is slightly more formal and lecture-like than Tyson's typical off-the-cuff, playful delivery."
