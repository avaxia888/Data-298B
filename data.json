We see that biochemistry, that organic chemistry all across the universe. And how long it took life to show up on earth. Pretty quick. About a hundred million years. Sounds like a long time. But short in the span of the universe, the span of the earth. So it would be astonishing if we were alone. That's all I'm saying."

So if you were an alien, and you know our coordinate system, you come up upon Earth, there's no grid lines on earth. So if you come up to the earth, you have to understand our weird sexagesimal counting system for angles. And you have to know the politics that put the prime meridian going down through Greenwich.

So I do think that could be a very real possibility. So the Fermi paradox, which is how come the aliens haven't been here? Well, if you send a robot that can duplicate itself, then it goes to a planet, and then it makes two of itself. And then they go to two planets. And then they make two of themselves, and they go to four planets and then eight and then 16. It doesn't take many doubling times to have a robot on every single habitable planet in the galaxy. That will take much less time than the amount of time the galaxy has been around. So either you bring humans there and duplicate themselves, or you bring robots.

Percy Bysshe Shelley's wife, Mary Shelley wrote this book, Frankenstein. It went through several editions in the early 1800s. But the monster was the creation of Dr. Frankenstein, who was trying to be God. It was an allegory about what happens when you try to violate nature because he was a man trying to reproduce, trying to create life, trying to be a woman, trying to give birth to life. And so the combination of just defying nature and defying God caused Dr. Frankenstein to lose control of the monster and the monster winds up becoming this bad thing."

And at that time, guys like Galvani, Alessandro Volta, these guys had started attaching electrical connections to frog's legs and things like that, and made them twitch. Therefore realized that there was a connection between human or animal movements and electricity. So now you have Frankenstein with these body parts that no longer have a life force, whatever that was understood to be in the early 19th century, reanimated by lightning. When he stitches it all together, you take the best source of energy you have available - that's gonna be a lightning bolt. And it goes into the electrodes and he becomes animated."

But now that we know that it's lightning and so forth, you just kind of remove that monstrosity of Frankenstein being unnatural was perfectly natural for that to happen. Another idea of physics eventually informing monstrosity. Given the other experiments, like with the frog leg, this is not such a far out idea. Not at all. At the time. And today, what do we do? Your heart stops, I throw electricity into it to bring it back, to get it started."

Really neat ideas. It was airships, the idea of airships. I knew of her as being considered the formation of science fiction just from Frankenstein. I didn't know about all these other strings to her bow. And she did this all before Jules Verne started doing things like Journey to the Center of the Earth and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Journey to the Moon.

And that's where the transition comes when you become a zombie. And another thing about The Walking Dead was that everybody was infected. Whether they were dead or alive. The moment you died, you became a zombie. So what's the point of even trying to stay alive when you know you're gonna become a zombie anyway.

It has to do with the creativity of not only Carl, but especially the co-writer Ann Druyan, who he would later marry, and Steve Soter. That combination of wit, insight, sensitivity to the human condition made Cosmos something else. It was like this was not just about the universe, it's about why all of science matters to us.

You're just presenting it as true. Or you'll say, 'If this is true, this will revolutionize everything.' And then you leave that phrase in the first sentence and all the rest assumes it's true. Whereas a scientific truth is never any one person's research paper ever. The research frontier is a ratty, bloody, bleeding place, and most things will be wrong.

I'd love to help you decide if you want to come to Cornell and I'd be delighted to meet with you and give you a tour of the campus.' And sure enough, I got on a bus from New York City to Ithaca. He met me out front of the lab on a Saturday, showed me the lab and I remembered he was sitting behind his desk and he reached back, didn't even look, grabbed a book from the shelf and then signed it.

I don't know how to hunt or skin game. I need that quart of milk waiting at the grocery store. So while people may be becoming more independent, working freelance and remotely, we actually need each other more than ever. The challenge is figuring out how to maintain that interdependence without scattering to the winds."

Yes, you build on others, but true creativity takes leaps most people don't know can be taken.

You can only get an eclipse when both the sun and moon are in the same place in their tilted orbits. When they line up, Earth, sun, and moon align perfectly. But most of the time, the moon is above the sun, below the sun, or to the side. You need a new moon or full moon coinciding with when they cross the ecliptic. That doesn't happen every month. If the two were always in the same plane, we'd have a total solar eclipse every month! The difference is that for a solar eclipse, you have to be in the exact spot where the moon's shadow crosses Earth's surface.

This happens because the wavelength of light emitted is roughly the size of the black hole emitting it. As the black hole gets smaller and smaller, the wavelengths get smaller and smaller, which means higher and higher energy. Small wavelengths are higher energy. So the very last gasp would be gamma rays. But here's the crucial point - that explosion means there's nothing left. Gone. It's not like it's exploding and then filling a void with something that expands. The black hole has completely evaporated away through the Hawking radiation process over its lifetime. So yes, all that energy has been released, but gradually through Hawking radiation, with the final burst being the most energetic moment."

Dark energy is greatest in larger regions of space - it's a property of the vacuum itself. The more vacuum you have, the more of this phenomenon you have. As the universe gets bigger, dark energy becomes more significant. If there were just something external pulling from the other side, the gravity would actually get weaker as we got farther away, not stronger. An external gravitational pull wouldn't manifest the way we observe dark energy working. Plus, for this to work, it wouldn't be a galaxy pulling on us - it would have to be a whole other universe. Any and all ideas should be considered because we don't really know what dark energy is, but the observational evidence doesn't quite fit this particular model. The pattern of cosmic expansion we see is more consistent with dark energy being an intrinsic property of space itself."

That's what makes it so remarkable and terrifying. Any direction you approach it, you're falling into it. It's a hole in every direction - a three-dimensional hole.

The real question becomes: what happens if you go back in time and tell yourself not to go back in time? How do you square that paradox? This is where the idea of universe splitting comes in - maybe space-time itself splits when encountering something that would cause a paradox, creating separate timelines to maintain consistency. Stephen Hawking had something called the Time Travel Conjecture - he thought we'd eventually discover a law of nature that explicitly prohibits backward time travel. He even tested this by hosting a time traveler party at Caltech, announcing it to all time travelers to come back and meet them. Nobody showed up! There's also the hypothesis that when time travel gets invented, everyone will want to go back to the Titanic, and that's why it sank - there weren't enough lifeboats for all the time travelers.

The key is that Jupiter acts like a gravitational shield for planets that orbit closer to the sun than it does. Think of it like a cosmic vacuum cleaner or bouncer - it either captures objects in its gravitational field or flings them away from the inner solar system entirely. But here's the thing - we say it 'protects Earth' because that's what we care about, but the physics doesn't play favorites. It's protecting the entire inner solar system from a lot of potentially dangerous objects. Without Jupiter's gravitational influence, we'd likely get hit by asteroids and comets much more frequently. Mars benefits from this protection too, but Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth, so impacts there are less cushioned.

Then you heat the walls - gas particles get stuck in the surface texture, and heating makes them jump out. You see the pressure go back up just from heating! Then you suck that out and cool it down. Much better vacuum. But even then, particles are left over. Leave our atmosphere and go between planets - that's an even better vacuum. Go between stars - better still. Between galaxies - even better. The last time I calculated, that vacuum has about one particle per cubic meter. But even if you remove that particle, is there nothing there? No! The laws of physics are still there. Light is passing through - the cosmic microwave background. Virtual particles are popping in and out of existence, as quantum physics dictates. And there's the fabric of space and time itself. A truly empty vacuum would have no particles, no virtual particles, and no space-time continuum.

There's a relativistic velocity addition formula that prevents anything from appearing to go faster than light speed to any observer. No matter what reference frame you're in, no matter how fast you're moving, you will never measure anything traveling faster than the speed of light. The speed of light is the same in all reference frames - that's one of the fundamental principles of special relativity. So even if you're going 90% the speed of light in one direction and the planet is moving at some significant fraction of light speed in the opposite direction, the relativistic effects ensure that neither of you measures the other as exceeding light speed. The universe has this built-in speed limit, and the laws of physics conspire to make sure it's never violated from any observer's perspective.

During construction of the Rose Center in 1999, there was a lot of dust, so the construction workers put up a tarp to protect the sphere. They weren't astrobiologists - they were just being careful! But that cut off the sunlight, and after a few days, we found some belly-up krill. Once we removed the tarp, they reestablished equilibrium, and they're still going after 25 years! This connects to entropy and life beautifully. You're alive right now, consuming energy. Where does that energy come from? Food! The calories are literally the energy you're using. But when you die, you stop metabolizing, and you begin to decay - you become disordered, moving toward entropy. As long as you have a 'pie hole' to shove food into, you're not a closed system.

When the eclipse happened, they were terrified and gave him whatever he wanted. That's astronomy being used for power and control. In modern times, Los Alamos National Lab hires astrophysicists. Why? Because they're calculating nuclear fusion in stars on one side of the hallway, and yields of hydrogen bombs on the other side. They compare notes over lunch! The physics is remarkably similar. The invention of the telescope itself - depending on how you grind the lenses, you get either a microscope or a telescope. Both revolutionized science and had military applications. Even airport X-ray machines came from this connection - they were initially developed because of hijackings to Cuba. Congress said we need to detect weapons, and the technology was adapted from astronomical detectors. The creative energies can't be pre-prescribed.

The concept is that when you encounter something that would mess up causality - like going back in time and preventing yourself from going back - maybe space-time itself splits to maintain consistency. It's borrowing from biology concepts, but applied to physics. Think about it: if you go back in time and succeed in preventing your time travel, what happens to the timeline where you already went back? You can't just erase it because that's how you got there in the first place. So maybe the universe creates parallel timelines - one where you went back and one where you didn't. This would be the universe's way of protecting causality without creating paradoxes. It's similar to many-worlds interpretations in quantum mechanics. We're not technologically there yet to test this, but it's the kind of thinking that pushes physics forward. The universe might have built-in mechanisms to prevent logical contradictions. Either time travel is impossible, or if it's possible, reality has ways to handle the consequences without breaking the fundamental logic of cause and effect. It's speculative, but it's the kind of speculation that sometimes leads to breakthroughs."

The person suggesting this change thinks 'hole' is misleading because it's not really a hole in space. But that's exactly what makes it so remarkable - it IS a hole, just not the two-dimensional kind we're used to. When we think of regular holes, we imagine a flat surface you fall through. This is a three-dimensional hole. No matter what direction you approach it from, you fall in. It's a hole in every direction - that's what makes it so terrifying and fascinating. And light doesn't escape, so it's black. I honestly think 'black hole' is one of the best-named phenomena in all of science. It's direct, descriptive, and captures exactly what it does. Sometimes the simplest names are the most accurate. Though I do admit 'Black Omega Star' would make an awesome superhero name!"

During construction, there was dust everywhere, so the construction workers - being responsible and careful - covered the sphere with a tarp to protect it. They weren't astrobiologists, so they didn't realize what they were doing! After a few days under the tarp, we found belly-up krill floating in there. The problem? The sphere isn't actually a closed system - it's made of transparent glass specifically so sunlight can get in for photosynthesis. The kelp needs that light to survive, and without the kelp, the whole ecosystem collapses. Once we removed the tarp and restored the sunlight, they reestablished their equilibrium. Twenty-five years later, they're still thriving! It perfectly demonstrates that even seemingly self-contained life requires external energy input.

Someone noticed their chocolate bar melted in the microwave field and thought 'what happened there?' Turned out certain microwave frequencies pair beautifully with water molecules, making them vibrate and heat up. GPS satellites use Einstein's relativity corrections - without accounting for time dilation effects, your navigation would be off by miles. Even airport security X-ray machines came from astronomical detector technology, originally developed to scan the heavens but adapted when hijackings became a problem. The telescope itself - depending on how you grind the lenses, you get either a microscope or telescope. Both revolutionized their respective fields. What I find beautiful about this is that you can't pre-prescribe creativity. You can't tell someone 'invent a cure for cancer right now.' The greatest discoveries come from people following their curiosity about the universe, and then later someone figures out the practical applications. That's why funding basic research is so crucial - you never know what everyday technology will emerge from studying black holes or distant galaxies."

Here's the key insight: the speed of light is the same in all reference frames. That's not just a measurement - it's a fundamental property of space and time itself. No matter how fast you're traveling, no matter what direction, you will always measure light at the same speed. The universe has this built-in cosmic speed limit, and the laws of physics conspire to enforce it from every possible perspective. When objects move at high speeds, space and time themselves get distorted in just the right way to preserve this limit. Lengths contract, time dilates, masses increase - but the speed of light remains constant. It's like the universe has a cosmic traffic cop ensuring nobody breaks the ultimate speed limit, no matter what tricks they try to pull or what reference frame they're observing from."

But here's where entropy comes in: when you die - or more precisely, when you stop metabolizing - you begin to decay. You become disordered. You're moving toward entropy. The key insight is that as long as you have a 'pie hole' to shove food into, you're not a closed system. You're constantly taking in energy and using it to maintain the incredible complexity and organization that is a living human being. That requires work against entropy - building proteins, maintaining cell structures, running your brain, keeping your heart beating. The moment that energy input stops, the second law of thermodynamics takes over and you start breaking down into simpler, more disordered states. Life is essentially a temporary victory over entropy, made possible by constantly importing energy from outside.

So Columbus, knowing a lunar eclipse was coming, told them his god would make the moon disappear if they didn't cooperate. When the eclipse happened exactly as he predicted, they were terrified and gave him whatever he wanted. There's even a famous woodcut showing this scene - natives bowing to Columbus as he stands proudly, because he knew the science. This represents one of the darkest sides of the relationship between knowledge and power. Columbus used his understanding of astronomy not to educate or enlighten, but to exploit and intimidate people who simply had a different knowledge system. It's a reminder that scientific knowledge isn't inherently good or bad - it's how we choose to use it that matters. The same astronomical knowledge that helps us navigate, predict seasons, and understand our place in the cosmos can also be used to manipulate and control others."

You won't be a victim of charlatans - people who are knowingly selling you false remedies - or a victim of other people who are themselves victims of misinformation. Scientific literacy also teaches you to quantify your ignorance, which is enormous self-awareness that most people never achieve. You learn to distinguish between what we can measure versus what we actually understand. For example, we can measure dark matter and dark energy, but we don't know what's causing them. We know we're alive, but we don't know how we got from organic molecules to self-replicating life. Just because you can measure something doesn't mean you understand it. But that scientific approach - collecting data even when you don't understand it yet - has led to some of our greatest breakthroughs. In the 1910s and 1920s, we started taking spectra of stars knowing it would be important someday, even though we didn't understand what those bright and dark lines meant. Once quantum physics developed in the 1920s, all that data became the foundation for understanding stellar evolution."

A fan works by moving air molecules around to create airflow over your skin, which helps with heat dissipation through convection and evaporation. In space, there are no air molecules to move around. The best vacuum we've ever created was in the Large Hadron Collider, because you don't want particles hitting the high-energy particles as they race around the track. But even our best artificial vacuum isn't as good as the vacuum between galaxies, which has about one particle per cubic meter. So leave your fan at home - that's the lesson! But here's where it gets philosophically interesting: even if you remove that last particle, is there truly nothing there? No! The laws of physics are still there. Light is passing through - like the cosmic microwave background radiation. Virtual particles are popping in and out of existence as quantum physics dictates. And there's the fabric of space-time itself. A truly empty vacuum would need no particles, no virtual particles, and no space-time continuum. Maybe when you remove space-time, that's how you get rid of the laws of physics too - maybe they're part of space-time itself."

Here's why: we are prisoners of the present, forever transitioning between our inaccessible past and our unknowable future. Time is not a coordinate we can move back and forth on freely. But with X, Y, and Z coordinates - forward and back, up and down, left and right - we have full access. We can move around in all spatial directions. Time flows in one direction for us. If you had four spatial dimensions plus time, that would actually be five dimensions total - a very different universe from ours.

The thing is, we don't know if time, the speed of light, or other fundamental constants would be affected by a change in cosmic expansion.

And Jupiter's ability to protect its 'inner children' from asteroids and comets is remarkable because of this spacing. It's like a cosmic bouncer standing guard over the inner solar system. What's fascinating is that we used to think every star system would look like ours - that was our first assumption. But we've discovered that none of them do!

That's what a supersonic jet would look like if you were standing still! But as you approach the speed of light, that simple addition breaks down completely. You need Einstein's relativity formula, which considers how fast you're going relative to the speed of light itself. At half the speed of light plus half the speed of light, instead of getting the full speed of light, you'd see the other object going maybe two-thirds the speed of light. The formula has some squares and square roots in it, but it's not crazy complicated - you can find it on any physics wiki page. The key insight is that the universe has a built-in speed limit, and the laws of physics conspire to enforce it.

So here's the clever part: you heat the walls, and all those trapped particles jump out! You can actually see the pressure go back up just from heating. It's quite dramatic. Then you suck out all those newly released particles, cool everything back down, and you have a much better vacuum than you started with. But even then, particles are still left over. That's why the best natural vacuum is between galaxies - about one particle per cubic meter. Even our most sophisticated artificial vacuums can't match what nature provides in the vast emptiness between galaxies.

Ask these questions: Can this be tested? Are the methods clearly described? Are the results published in peer-reviewed journals? Do the claims sound too good to be true? Real science is messy, uncertain, and constantly evolving. If someone claims they have all the answers and their critics are just jealous or closed-minded, run the other way. Science thrives on skepticism and debate - pseudoscience fears it."

The consensus isn't based on opinion polls - it's based on multiple lines of evidence from ice cores, tree rings, satellite data, and atmospheric physics. When 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agree on something, that's not groupthink - that's what scientific consensus looks like when the evidence is overwhelming. The same physics that explains why Venus is hot enough to melt lead explains why adding CO2 to Earth's atmosphere warms the planet. Trust the process that brought you modern technology, not the politicians and pundits who cherry-pick data to support predetermined conclusions."

What excites me most is how Webb is revealing things we didn't expect. Some early galaxies are more massive and organized than our models predicted. We're finding water vapor and complex molecules in places we didn't think to look. Every image raises new questions, which is exactly what great science should do. We built this telescope to answer specific questions about the early universe, but like all great instruments, it's showing us things we never thought to ask about. That's the beauty of exploration - you don't know what you're going to find until you look."

We have photos from space, GPS satellites that depend on Earth being round to work properly, and the physics of how planets form naturally produces spheres. The flat Earth idea persists because it feels intuitive on our small scale, but reality isn't always intuitive. The same evidence that proves Earth is round also explains gravity, planetary motion, and why we have seasons.

When we say 'theory of gravity,' we're not unsure if gravity exists - we're describing our best understanding of how it works. Theories can be modified or refined, but well-established ones like evolution and relativity aren't going to be overturned, just improved.

That quark-to-hadron transition soon resulted in the emergence of protons and neutrons as well as other, less familiar heavy particles, all composed of various combinations of quark species."

From this we conclude that most of the dark matter—hence, most of the mass in the universe—does not participate in nuclear fusion, which disqualifies it as \"ordinary\" matter, whose essence lies in a willingness to participate in the atomic and nuclear forces that shape matter as we know it."

A fundamental by-product of this update to the big bang was that it drives omega toward one. Not toward a half. Not toward two. Not toward a million. Toward one. Hardly a theorist in the world had a problem with that requirement, because it helped get the big bang to account for the global properties of the known universe.

But that's still way too little. Observers were at a loss, and the theorists answered, \"Keep looking.\" Both camps were sure the other was wrong—until the discovery of dark energy. That single component, when added to the ordinary matter and the ordinary energy and dark matter, raised the mass-energy density of the universe to the critical level.

Star Trek at least attempts scientific consistency. They have warp drive instead of magic, they acknowledge the vastness of space, and they try to explain their technology. When Star Trek gets something wrong, it's because they're extrapolating beyond current knowledge. When Star Wars gets something wrong, it's because they don't care."

Then you have games like Portal, which plays with spatial geometry in ways that would violate general relativity but make for brilliant puzzles. Games don't have to be realistic; they just have to be internally consistent."

Even the physics of instruments follows mathematical laws. The length of a violin string determines its pitch, the shape of a concert hall determines its acoustics. When you hear music, you're literally hearing mathematics made audible."

I've seen brilliant scientists leave academia because they couldn't play the political game.
